# Image Classification Using Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a neural network model for image classification. The goal is to accurately classify images into predefined categories using deep learning. By training on a dataset of labeled images, the neural network learns to identify unique features associated with each category, allowing it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen images.

## Key Features

Customizable neural network architecture: Supports flexible adjustments in layers and units.
Preprocessing pipeline: Includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation for improved generalization.
Training and Evaluation: The model can be trained on custom datasets and evaluated using accuracy metrics.
Support for common libraries: Built using popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch for easy implementation and extension.
